# Intro to AI: Student Project Showcase

## Description

This repository is a curated collection of exemplary projects chosen by students in the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class for in-depth study and implementation. Each project falls under a specific AI category like computer vision, natural language processing, transformers, games, etc. This method enables students to deepen their understanding of AI through practical experience, akin to how artists master their craft by replicating masterpieces. Students either replicate the work described in papers, extend it for their own AI applications, or develop their own AI applications.
