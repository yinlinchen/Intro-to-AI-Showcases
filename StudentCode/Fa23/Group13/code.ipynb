    "This is the final step to generating all of the data. It will loop through every list of pieceLocations and place each permutation of pieces at those locations. In theory, for KPvK, there will be $64 \\times 63 \\times 62 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 2,999,808$ different positions. In practice, about a third of these are illegal (kings too close, kings starting in check, pawns on the very end or beginning of board). For each legal iteration, two matrices (layers) will be created, each one corresponding to a specific type of piece. The first matrix corresponds to the location of the pawn (in this case), and the second corresponds to the locations of the kings. White pieces have a `1` at their square, and black pieces have a `-1`, while all other squares get a `0`.\n",

    "***WARNING: The following code took more than 9 hours to run.*** The code prints roughly every 30 seconds with how far along it is and an estimate of how much longer is left. Each time, it prints, it also attempts to save everything. However, this doesn't actually work. The reason it is still kept is because you might need to pause the code. For some reason, trying to stop the kernel doesn't work, but with the `dump_session` command running, stopping the kernel causes an error and forces the kernel to stop. After it successfully stops ***make sure to run the next line of code***. This is another `dump_session` line, but this time it actually works. Stopping the kernel while saving corrupts the save file, so you won't be able to load it again if need be. ***Make sure to save it again after***. However, as the loop continues, the `dump_session` command will slowly start to take longer each iteration, since the file size is getting bigger. The best thing to do is stop the kernel, make sure to save once more, copy the save and rename it, print out and note the `currentIndex` variable, and restart the kernel to remove all variables. After restarting, replace the `0` in `currentIndex` with whatever value you noted, and start it again. Keep doing this process to keep the loop time fast, and at the end you can load all of them individually and combine them into one variable and perform one last save. Make sure to rename the `outMatrices` and `scores` variables each time you load a save when you're combining them, otherwise you'll overwrite them."
