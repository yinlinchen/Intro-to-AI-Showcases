 # Building an Expert Agent for 2048

Leveraging AI Algorithms and Game Theory Optimization Solutions for Maximizing Score

Introduction:

The game 2048 is a popular web based and mobile puzzle game. The objective of the game is to create a tile with the value of 2048. The more experienced players can of course aim for a score and tile higher than 2048, however it should be noted that the game does of course become significantly more challenging as the game progresses. The rules of the game are simple, the player merges tiles of the same value to form larger tiles. While simple to understand, it can be challenging to play optimally as a result of the randomness of the new tile generation and also due to the decreasing search space as the player progresses and must manage more tiles. For the following project, our team aims to build an expert agent based on a reinforcement learning agent created by Anav Mehta, that can play the game 2048 while also using advanced AI algorithms and game theory optimization solutions.

Problem Statement:

For our project we plan to build an expert agent that can play the game 2048. We aim to develop an AI agent that can maximize its score by deciding on the optimal move each turn. The agent should be able to handle the constraints of the game, such as the space available on the board, and the randomness of the tile generation while also achieving its performance related objectives. Options for agent design will be implemented and assessed to determine the most optimal agent design to play the game 2048.
