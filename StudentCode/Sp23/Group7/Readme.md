# Running the Code

Prior to running the code we recommend being on a server with a gpu and a high amount of RAM. We believe it will still run on cpu if needed but we havent tested. It would have a very long run time on a cpu.

You must download the dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=2

Mount on a google drive and name it archive.zip

The notebook should run and establish the model. 

Upload photos of your dog or a dog and photos of a human or yourself.

Now you will be able to run the test functions what_am_i() and predict_breed_transfer()
